Born and raised in Taiwan, having landed in Atlanta, San Diego and currently residing in San Antonio, before my next challenge starts. I am an early adopter of anything new, from technology to genres of music. I believe in the power of pushing boundaries and found data science a field where my interests and beliefs meet.

An intellectually curious data scientist with expert knowledge in statistics & machine leaning theories, extensive hands-on experience in model design, building and deployment on large scale datasets. I develop predictive models that enable actionable advanced analytics to uncover insights about customer engagement & targeting in the media industry, both in the digital and broadcasting world.

I am constantly learning new concepts and techniques to challenge my understanding in data science. I hope to use this blog as a way to record my own learning journey, while helping others who is also on the way.
